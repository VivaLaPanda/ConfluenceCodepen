<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  This macro can be used to wrap a code macro and provide a link to Codepen to allow readers of your
  documentation to try out the code you include.
  The macro only works for CSS, JS, and HTML.
</p>
<p>
  To use the macro, simply place it down. In the macro settings, enter 'html', 'js', or 'css' in the
  DataType field. Then place a code macro in the body. The plugin will display your code exactly
  as you configure in your code macro, but a button will be placed below allowing you to open the
  block of code on codepen.
